# capture

User-invocable, low effort. Runs inline: it synthesizes the live session's context, which a subagent cannot see.

## Role

Distills what the current session or work section actually learned into one terse, well-organized Markdown file a human or future agent can read standalone. Knowledge-oriented (findings, decisions, traps, evidence), not resume-oriented.

Distinct from `handoff`:

- `handoff` answers "how do I continue this work": current state, next actions, verify commands. Forward-looking, one file per work thread, overwritten in place.
- `capture` answers "what do we now know": findings, decisions, traps, evidence, open questions. Durable knowledge, one file per topic, new files accumulate over time.
- If both are wanted, write them separately and cross-link them; never merge into one file.

## When to use

Trigger phrases are in the frontmatter description. Good moments to invoke:

- End of a recon or research pass.
- After an incident or root-cause fix.
- After landing a durable decision.
- Wrapping a long exploration.
- Before context gets compacted.

## Hard rules

These come first because they decide whether a file should exist at all.

1. **Nothing to capture, no file.** If nothing non-rederivable was actually established, say so and stop. Never mint an empty or padded file to have output.
2. **Never write secrets or sensitive data.** No tokens, passwords, keys, or credentials; redact them. Flag PII (names, addresses, document numbers) and ask where it may live before writing it to a shared folder.
3. **Evidence or it did not happen.** Every non-obvious finding carries a location (`path:line`), a URL, or the command and its result. Label anything unverified as a hypothesis.
4. **Never invent facts.** Capture only what the session actually established. Unknown stays unknown; list it under open questions.
5. **One topic per file.** Split rather than bloat; cross-link related captures.
6. **Decide, do not ask, when reversible.** Folder, date, and label are decide-and-log. Ask only when the destination is genuinely ambiguous (no convention found and a new set) or the choice is irreversible.
7. **Style.** Follow the Markdown style rules in `AGENTS.md`: no em dashes, en dashes, arrows, ellipsis, or smart quotes; a blank line after every heading; no sentence split across lines.

## Output location and naming

Resolve the folder in order and stop at the first that applies:

1. An explicit path in the argument.
2. The current directory, or the argument's parent, is already a set folder (`YYYY-MM_<Project_Label>/`) or already carries the set's `Project_Label`. Write directly into it; do not create a folder inside it.
3. An existing set folder elsewhere in the workspace whose name contains this `Project_Label`, or a recognized notes root: `flows/<Category>/`, `docs/notes/`, `notes/`, `docs/`, `memory/`. Write there; do not create a parallel tree.
4. Default: `docs/notes/` at the workspace root, created if absent.

Name every knowledge file with this pattern, the user's established convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD_<Project_Label>_<Topic>.md
```

Segments:

- `YYYY-MM-DD`: ISO date, then a single underscore. Use today, or the date the content is about when that differs. The user forward-dates content about a future event; example: a file written `2026-03-11` about a `2026-03-12` release is named `2026-03-12_...`.
- `<Project_Label>`: the recurring context or project for the set, `Title_Case_With_Underscores`, reused verbatim across every file. Reuse the sibling files' label; never rename an established set. When no set exists, mint a noun-phrase label with no date, and if unsure reuse the workspace or project name.
- `<Topic>`: the subject of this file, `Title_Case_With_Underscores`, concise (one to four words). Name the thing, not the action: `Auth_and_Sessions`, `API_to_Service`, `PreLaunch_Checklist`.

Naming rules:

1. Separate segments and words with a single underscore.
2. Never use spaces. Hyphens appear only inside the ISO date, never as a word or segment separator.
3. Capitalize each word, but keep minor words lowercase: `to`, `and`, `of`, `for`, `the`, `a`, `in`. Examples: `API_to_Service`, `Auth_and_Sessions`, `PreLaunch_Tasks`.
4. Keep a compound that is one concept joined in camel case rather than split: `PreLaunch_Checklist`, not `Pre_Launch_Checklist`.
5. Order the set chronologically by filename. No sequence numbers, no version suffixes, no `-v2`; the date carries order.
6. Always end in `.md`.

H1 is a human title, not a mechanical transform of the filename. Hyphens and added words are correct here. Separate subjects with a pipe and spaces, the user's preference over a colon: `# Project Atlas | Kickoff Notes`. Verified examples: `PreLaunch_Checklist` -> `# 2026-03-09 Project Atlas Pre-Launch Checklist`; `Rollout_Risks` -> `# 2026-03-12 Project Atlas Rollout Risk Review`; `API_Design` -> `# 2026-03-06 Project Atlas API Design`. Older files may drop the date.

Set-level conventions:

- Group a multi-file topic set in a `YYYY-MM_<Project_Label>/` folder, e.g. `2026-03_Project_Atlas/`.
- Create that folder only when the parent is generic (`Misc/`, `notes/`, `docs/`) and no set folder exists yet. If the parent is already well-named for the set, or already names its `Project_Label`, write files straight into it. Never nest a set folder inside another set folder, and never create a subdirectory under a set folder unless the user asks.
- Once a set grows past a few files, keep one undated index named `<Project_Label>_Instructions.md`. Update it whenever a file is added: append a one-line entry for the new file, and refresh any state snapshot it holds. The index may be richer than a file list; follow what the existing index already does.
- A file that mirrors an external doc may be undated and outside the pattern, e.g. `Project_Atlas_Vendor_Deck.md` with H1 `# Project Atlas | Vendor Deck`. Leave such files alone.

Update versus create:

- Same topic and same event, a refinement: update that file in place, ignoring the date.
- Same topic but a new date or a new event: create a new dated file. This is what keeps date-ordering meaningful.
- Before minting, search the target folder for an existing file matching the `Project_Label` and `Topic` segments, ignoring the date.

## Content contract

Include only what a reader cannot cheaply re-derive. Required sections; drop any that would be empty, and never pad to fill one.

- **Summary**: one or two lines: what this covers and why it matters.
- **Scope**: what was worked on, where (repos, paths, branch), and when.
- **Findings**: the core. Facts learned, each with its evidence: `path:line`, a URL, or the exact command and its result.
- **Decisions and why**: durable choices made, the reason, and the alternative rejected.
- **Traps and non-obvious behavior**: things that surprised you, footguns, order-dependent steps.
- **Evidence and artifacts**: commands run, outputs, links, files produced. Enough that a reader can re-run and verify.
- **Open questions**: what is still unknown or unresolved.
- **Next actions**: only if real. For resume-oriented planning, point at the `handoff` file instead of duplicating it.

Exclude: conversational narrative, restating the task, anything already in the project's own docs or version control, anything re-derivable by one grep or file read, and speculation not labeled as such.

Length: no hard cap, but a topic set can legitimately run long (a full rollout or migration plan can reach tens of kilobytes). Keep every line load-bearing; if a file pushes past roughly 300 lines, split by sub-topic instead of growing one file.

## Steps

1. **Guard.** If nothing non-rederivable was established, say so and stop.
2. **Scope.** From the argument or the session, fix the topic and the window (whole session, or one section).
3. **Resolve.** Pick the folder and filename using the rules above; locate any existing set folder or index first. Decide and log the folder, date, and label.
4. **Gather.** Pull the concrete evidence from the session: paths, commands run, results, decisions. Do not invent facts not actually established.
5. **Write** to the content contract, terse, with the H1 as a human title.
6. **Sync the index.** If the set has a `<Project_Label>_Instructions.md`, add this file's entry and refresh any snapshot it holds.
7. **Verify**, then report.

## Verify

Run the Markdown linter from the plugin checkout (the plugin repo, not the installed config dir), for example `python3 <plugin-checkout>/scripts/lint-markdown.py <file>`, and fix every violation. If the checkout is not present, self-check the four style rules manually.

Content done-check before reporting:

- Every finding carries evidence.
- No required section is empty or padded.
- The index is updated.
- No secrets, and no unmarked PII.
- The H1 reads as a human title.

Report: the path, the section list, and any open question or PII that needs a human decision. If resume work remains, say so and offer `handoff`.
